[-][/c]\n[c][808080][i]Use extreme caution.[-][/i][-][/c] \n\nDuring a planet's formation, most of the heavy elements sink down into the core. \nBut if a cosmic accident strips a world of it's outer layers, or if there was abundant material - then there can be such a thing as a 'metal planet'. \n\nIn any case, there will be a 'thin' silicate mantle left, of 'just a few hundred' kilometers. \nStill, there are vast quantities left to mine, and deposits of heavy and exotic elements are readily accessible, too. \n\nSince this is a rare place, it attracts many 'protectors'. Only the really careful or the most powerful will find a way to navigate... -Trespassers, beware."

# ==============================================================
# Intended as a late-tier planet. Rich but dangerous.

# ==============================================================
# NOTES TO RESOURCE PLACEMENT:
# High-tier resources (Erestrum, Zacosium) are tied to dangerous POI, which will _only_ spawn close to the canyons.
# This will make all those resources guarded; requiring a 'sneaking run' through the canyons to get close.

# Tex channel 2 is iron ore. This is used in the biomes 'Canyon', 'ShallowCanyon' and 'CanyonEdge' as a 1m-thick wall coating. 
# - Rather diffcult to mine due to steep angle (and possibly nearby POI).
# The biome 'HighMountains' has a 1m-thick copper layer deep down (-80m).

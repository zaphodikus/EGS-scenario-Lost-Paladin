# Playfield Characteristics

Description: "This is a temperate planet with vast oceans, volcanic islands and large continents with mountain ranges. It has a breathable atmosphere. The average temperature is 23°C and gravity amounts to 0.84g."

PlanetType: Temperate             # Choose from pre-selection: Alien, Arid, Barren, Desert, Lava, Snow, Temperate    
PlayfieldType: Planet             # Ignore (do not change for planet playfield). Planet, Moon, Space, Sun      
Difficulty: 2                     # Integer [1, 5] Determines the ordering of planets in the New Game menu. Planets with low difficulty come first

BaseAttackCount: 0                # Integer [0, 1] Determines whether there are base attacks on this playfield. 0 =  no base attacks, 1 = base attacks enabled (later the INT will determine the number of simultaneous base attacks on a playfield). Default is BaseAttackCount: 1 

TraderZone: ExampleZone          # The TraderZone sets all traders that have #ZONE# selected from their TYPE dropdown setting to use the 'ExampleZone' Trading table set up under /Content/Configuration/TraderNPCConfig.ecf! Any entry from this file can be used as Traderzone!  Note: If you set a TraderZone to a POI via 'Properties' the Playfield-Trader Zone is not used for those POI. Furthermore if you set a specifc Trading Table to any Trader and do NOT use the #ZONE# setting from its dropdown, neither the Traderzone for a playfield, nor the traderzone for a POI group will be used for THAT particular trader (only!).

# ==============================================================
# Special parameters:
# ==============================================================

AllowHV: False                  # Dis-allow HVs to enter/spawn in this playfield, default is True
AllowSV: False                  # Dis-allow SVs to enter/spawn in this playfield, default is True
AllowCV: False                  # Dis-allow CVs to enter/spawn in this playfield, default is True
AllowBA: False                  # Dis-allow BAs to enter/spawn in this playfield, default is True

AllowMaxCPUTierBA: 2            # Set the max CPU Tier allowed; Only applies to spawning blueprints
AllowMaxCPUTierSV: 1            # Set the max CPU Tier allowed; Only applies to spawning blueprints
AllowMaxCPUTierHV: 3            # Set the max CPU Tier allowed; Only applies to spawning blueprints
AllowMaxCPUTierCV: 3            # Set the max CPU Tier allowed; Only applies to spawning blueprints

RestrictToOrigin: Human         # Only players of the defined origin are allowed to enter the playfield

AllowBlueprintSV: False         # Dis-allow to spawn SV Blueprint in this playfield, default is True
AllowBlueprintCV: False         # Dis-allow to spawn CV Blueprint in this playfield, default is True
AllowBlueprintBA: False         # Dis-allow to spawn BA Blueprint in this playfield, default is True
AllowBlueprintHV: False         # Dis-allow to spawn HV Blueprint in this playfield, default is True

# ==============================================================

Seed: 123456                    # Integer [1, 999999] If set overwrites main Seed 
UseFixed: True  			   	   # If set to True uses fixed POIs + resources in Survival mode (per default set to False). Can be used together with UseRandom
UseRandom: True				   # If set to True uses random POIs + resources in Survival mode (per default set to True). Can be used together with UseFixed
IndestructibleTerrain: True     # If set to True terrain on this playfield will be indestructible

# ==============================================================

# Removing or not using any of the following LandClaimZone settings has the same effect than using the 'LandClaimZone: Default' mode!
# Note: The LandClaimZone settings also apply to alien POIs. If you want to protect a POI with the LandClaimZone: Device mode active, the POI needs a Landclaim Device!
# Note: Antigrief zones set up for deposits in the gameoptions.yaml will ALWAYS exist and are NOT affected by any LandClaimZone mode. If you do (not) want deposits to be protected, please use the setup in the gameoptions.yaml
# Note: The gameoptions.yaml can be found at the top level in the games scenario folder and will be copied  over to the savegame folder when starting a new game. In this case, changes for a savegame need to be made there, and not in the scenario folder!

LandClaimZone: Default          # Use gameoptions.yaml to setup detailed values for either using AntiGriefDistancePvE and/or AntiGriefDistancePvP
LandClaimZone: Device           # IF either one or both AntiGriefDistancePvE and AntiGriefDistancePvP are activated in gameoptions.yaml, Antigrief zones will only exist for structures that have a Landclaim Device
LandClaimZone: Off              # This negates the settings made for both AntiGriefDistancePvE and AntiGriefDistancePvP in the gameoptions.yaml by setting all AntiGriefZones to OFF for this playfield only.

### POIs
# The POI spawning algorithm goes from top to down, so place important POIs on top to make sure they are placed. Moreover, the timing is as follows: 1. Drone base spawning, 2. POI spawning, 3. Resource deposit spawning 
# Add large objects on top of this list to avoid "too near" problems with other POIs

Description: "[c]Backwater world; meager resources. [-][/c]
\n
\nA small temperate moon, with unusual thick atmosphere - Even bristling with life!
\n
\n[i]So much things[/i] need to come together for such a world to occur: Water, a still fluid metal core, a decent size, in the right distance to the star...
\n
\nBut as a superficial scan indicates, this moon is [i]resource poor[/i]. So there is not much interest in things that empires do - To claim, exploit, settle, or even just to visit.
\n
\nThe drama of the universe continues elsewhere. While the canopies of the trees reach for sunlight.
\n
\nIt is still a great spot if you want to get out of sight, or just to stretch your legs and wander."

### Creatures ===========================   


# Spawn amounts: 'X creatures on a square kilometer'.
# ==============
# ! The large SSG creature symbols let the map look much 'fuller' than it is ingame ! (AND day and night creatures don't spawn on the same spot.)
# - This is just a rule-of-thumb description for the ingame 'feel', not for game's performance!

# === Guessing here...
# (Flat plains: Lower spawn rates are OK. Deep forests need more spawns to have creatures still visible.)
# Creatures in groups/ large creatures need less amount than small, single creatures.
# High creature detection range and high numbers = Much more dangerous.

# 15 Pangolins, Triceratopses... : A rare sight every few minutes. Huge size makes it easily recognizable.
# 25 LizardMules: Large creatures/group on flat plains in the far distance

# 75 Telluropods: About 1-2 in view range, mulling about. (Good for low detection single creatures)
# 90 RaptorsHerd  - Very dangerous night fights, even on flat terrain (See: Alien planet)
# 200+ Needs to spawn in a small biome (DustBowl), and /or is a single creature in a very low-visibility biome (Forest)
# 1000+ (Ultra-tiny biome spawn)


CreatureSpawning:
# This is a (mostly) peaceful planet with lots of life - Kind of a park.
# Minimal direct aggression on day.
# Nights are slightly dangerous.

Description: "Planets are born by the swirling, scattered ashes - the legacy of dead, exploded stars. 
\n...Gravity will collect all this messy debris, and give it a new form.
\n
\nBut a world's amount of rock and dust, slowly grinding, clumping together... will result in an enormous amount of friction.
\n
\nWhich means, [b][i]heat[/i][/b].
\n
\nThis place is just a mere quarter billion years old, and struggles to radiate all this excess heat into space -
\nThe bigger the planet, the longer it takes.
\n
\nIn this liquid state, the planet resembles more a giant cooking pot, or lava lamp, or a blast furnance:
\nContinents of less dense slag skim the surface, while the heavy, exotic metals sink into in planet's deep inner.
\n
\nYet, by thermal churning and stirring, some bits of that precious core will be again swept back out, in reach of the surface.
\n
\nFor those who brave these temperatures, there will be great rewards. "

Description: "[c][e0e020]Note:[-][/c]   [c]Deadly temperature differences![-][/c]
\n[c]Lots of resources, but [i][u]very[/u][/i] difficult to mine[-][/c]
\n[i][c][808080][i][b]Please use caution and prepare.[/b] 
\nYou likely will need specialized equipment and vessels to thrive here![/i][-][/c]
\n
\nThis barren, rocky planet, keeps nearest to its star... - Which is a bit too close for comfort.
\n
\nIts day side is heated near to the melting point, while the night side radiates into the vacuum of space.
\nThis constant temperature stress leaves deep scars in the surface, and fuels the growth of exotic crystals.
\n
\nDuring youth, this world even had part of its crust boiled away - Placing the heavy mantle deposits in scanner range - 
\n... But you will need all your calm, skill and experience to collect them. - Lest it becomes a greedy miner's grave: Slowly being cooked in your own, stuck vessel!
\n
\n
\nThis galaxy is huge. - - There are plenty of easier worlds to exploit, or home shores to settle.
\n
\nPeople still attracted to such murderous places could be of the unstable, dangerous kind:
\n[i]The foolish, the violent, the crazy, the lawless...[/i]
\n
\nDucking away, underground or in the shadows- Escaping the glare of the day... while their bases crumble and groan by the stretching of metal."

# Very risky to mine without a vessel (or needs _lots and lots_ of water bottles!)

# ! RESOURCE DEPTHS AND TYPES ARE FITTED TO THE UNDERGROUND LAYERS !  - See playfield_dynamic.yaml

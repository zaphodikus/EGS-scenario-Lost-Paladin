# Description: "Water is quite common in the universe, as life-enabling liquid, or at least as ice or vapor.\nHowever, not every planet is gifted with water. Some worlds get scorched by their home star, or maybe their magnetic field is too weak to stem against the push of the stellar wind.\n\nBut even this place of glaring sunshine has managed to keep some spots here or there..."
Description: "This planet suffered an unknown cataclysm; turning it into an ash-desert.
\n
\nBut there were still survivors:
\nOut of the drains and the burrows, life slowly explores a strange new world."

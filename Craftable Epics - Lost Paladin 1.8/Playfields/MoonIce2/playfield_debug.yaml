Description: "[c]Backwater world; meager resources. [-][/c]
\n[i][c][808080][i](Calculating the [b]map markers[/b] by statistical probability. - Sorry, no guarantees given!)[/i][-][/c]
\n
\n[i]Once upon a time,[/i] ... the planets were still forming. Gaining mass and changing their paths around their star.
\n
\nGravitational disturbances sweeped through the whole system, hurtling planetisimals everywhere.
\n
\n... This is a wanderer, born and expelled from the stellar asteroid belt. 
\nIt got caught up by the nearby large planet. - Somehow avoiding to collide, or to be flung away.
\n
\nBut during those narrow, chaotic first passes, it experienced massive tidal forces. -
\nKneading it like dough, close of ripping it apart. 
\n
\n
\n- Times are much calmer now.
\n
\nAnd with that, all those scars make for impressive vistas, and stories of adventure."

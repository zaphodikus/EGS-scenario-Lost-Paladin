#==== Required / Needed Plants
# > Need to have at least ONE for each item SOMEWHERE on the planet!
# Note: Players MIGHT retrieve some seeds or harvest things from the “farms” that are around, but we do not take that for granted. 
# IMPORTANT: try to stick to a UNIQUE-PER-BiOME approach for harvestable plants! (for example a BrainFungus always grows in Marshlands/Swamps, but never in the Woods)

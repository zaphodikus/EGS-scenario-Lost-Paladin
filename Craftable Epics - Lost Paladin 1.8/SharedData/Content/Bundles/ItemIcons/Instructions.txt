This folder is where you place .jpg or .png images for item icons. 100x100 .png files with transparent background are best.
If the icon image has the exact same name as the item or block name in your config files then it will automatically use it.
Otherwise you can add CustomIcon: to your item, block, or token configs to reference the icon in this folder.

For example, CustomIcon: TestIcon will reference the TestIcon.png file in this folder.
